## 2. Daily Morning Routine

**Time: ~7:00 AM — Open the app and check today's activity.**

### Step 1: Review the Dashboard

The home screen shows everything you need at a glance:

- **Available rooms** — how many rooms are free right now
- **Checkouts today** — how many guests are leaving
- **Today's revenue** — income so far
- **Room grid** — color-coded room status (green = available, red = occupied, yellow = cleaning, orange = maintenance)

### Step 2: Check Upcoming Departures

Scroll down to **"Upcoming Checkout"**. Each card shows:

- Room number
- Guest name
- Expected checkout time (e.g., "Expected: 12:00")
- **Check Out** button (green) — tap to check them out immediately

### Step 3: Check Upcoming Arrivals

Below departures, see **"Upcoming Check-in"**:

- Room number
- Guest name
- Expected arrival time (e.g., "Expected: 14:00")
- **Check In** button — tap when the guest arrives

### Step 4: Room Status at a Glance

The room grid uses colors:

| Color | Status | Meaning |
|-------|--------|---------|
| Green | Available | Ready for guests |
| Red | Occupied | Guest currently staying |
| Yellow | Cleaning | Housekeeping in progress |
| Orange | Maintenance | Under repair |
| Grey | Blocked | Not available for booking |

**Quick tip:** Long-press any room card to quickly change its status without opening the detail screen.

Tap the **+ New Booking** button (floating button on dashboard or bookings screen).

### Step 2: Select a Room

- The dropdown only shows rooms **available** for your selected dates

### Step 3: Add the Guest

- Tap check-out date → their departure date
- Number of nights calculates automatically

### Step 5: Fill Required Fields

- Number of guests
- Rate per night (pre-filled, adjust if needed)

- Internal notes

### Step 7: Save

Tap **Create Booking**. The booking is created with status **Pending**.

- **Deposit amount**: Enter if they paid a deposit
- **Payment method**: Select how they paid the deposit
